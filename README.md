# cs340-project

We created three seperate algorithms: one for the original algorithm without any extensions, one modifying the original to implement extensions 1-4 and a final new algorithm for extension 5. They are found in their respective folders with instructions on how to call the scripts on input constraints and student preferences. To see directions for parsing the real data into input constraints and student pereferences that will be used to run the algorithms on, look at the folder titled brynmawr.

We also have a bunch of extra folders with tests and schedules we created.
